                <p>Did you know that the set menu at Abri is never really “set” per se? It’s Katsuaki Okiyama’s specialty: four plates, described to you out loud and with the guarantee that the next table over, who arrived five minutes after you, won’t be eating the same thing! <br> Savor it in the tiny bomb-shelter-like space, with a few clever details (stainless steel suspension light fixtures which let insiders know that the house actually has good taste…). And since we’re not coming to Abri for the décor (there isn’t any), we focus all of our energy instead of the missiles sent out by the dynamic chef (ex-Agapé Bis).</p>

                <p>Roland Gauthier’s century-old farmhouse buildings have been woken up by the biting embrace of his son Alexandre’s fiery forges… Everything is there, decked out in glass and steel by the architect Patrick Bouchain. <br> In this post-industrial theater, amongst his punk gardens, Gauthier junior his been working on his transgressive techniques since 2003. The sensitive son oscillates between aestheticism and archaism for a powerful nosedive into his mental terroir.</p>

                <p>First, the bad news: you’re probably not going to get into Septime. Not unless you’re willing to call exactly three weeks before your desired reservation, and probably not even then. Septime is still the best contemporary tasting menu in Paris. <br>In particular, a dish of lobster with earthy boudin noir and tart wild strawberries provided a mind-bending and delicious jolt to every diner at our table. Beverage pairings are consistently brilliant, leaning heavily toward natural wines but without the ill-chosen funk we often encounter elsewhere.</p>
